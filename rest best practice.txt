Specific Exception Handling:

You handle a specific exception (SpineException) with a BAD_REQUEST status, which is good for providing detailed feedback on known error conditions.
Generic Exception Handling:

You handle all other exceptions with a INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR status, which is a standard practice to ensure that unexpected errors are not exposed to the client.
Logging:

You log both types of exceptions with appropriate error messages, which is important for debugging and monitoring.
Overall, the structure and logic are solid. However, there are a few points you might consider:

Improvements
Exception Message Exposure:

Be cautious about exposing the exact exception message in the response. While it is useful for debugging, it might expose sensitive information. Consider logging detailed messages but returning a more generic message to the client.
Response Structure:

You can standardize the response structure to provide a consistent API experience. For example, you might return a JSON object with status, message, and data fields.
